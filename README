PACKAGING

  Packages are created dynamically by the package.py script located in the buildscripts directory. This will 
  generate RPM and Debian packages.


32 BIT BUILD NOTES

  MongoFS uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) File systems.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development File systems.
